# Webpage

My personal webpage, accessible through multiple domains:

- **http://nukuhack.szakdoga.net**: Only accessible in Hungary and not actively maintained.
- **https://nukuhack.netlify.app**: The preferred domain due to its ease of setup and regular updates.
- **https://nukuhack.github.io**: Automatically generated and updated, though it is not a primary focus.

## Structure
The repository contains the source files for the webpage, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## License

## Acknowledgments
- Hosted using Netlify, GitHub Pages, and a Hungarian domain for experimentation purposes.
